* Dotfiles
** Basic Structure
*** When I set up a new laptop.  I usually just go [[https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall][Archinstall]] or something like [[https://endeavouros.com/][EndeavourOS]].
*** I use [[https://awesomewm.org/][AwesomeWM]] as my everyday Window Manager.  I also have xfce installed just in case I break awesome beyond repair...
** Install
*** `git clone https://github.com/jimmycozza/dotfiles`
*** `cd dotfiles && ./archSetup.sh`
*** enjoy
** Neovim
*** Mostly Lua
*** Packer.nvim as my plugin manager
** Doom Emacs
*** I can't stop using org mode and magit, so I also have some basic config for when I use doom as my daily driver.
** Arch Setup
** Rofi
** Alacritty
** Sxhkd
** Picom
