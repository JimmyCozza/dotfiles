* Dotfiles
** Basic Structure
*** When I set up a new laptop.  I usually just go [[https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall][Archinstall]] or something like [[https://endeavouros.com/][EndeavourOS]].
*** I use [[https://awesomewm.org/][AwesomeWM]] as my everyday Window Manager.  I also have xfce installed just in case I break awesome beyond repair...
** Install
*** `git clone https://github.com/jimmycozza/dotfiles`
*** `cd dotfiles && ./archSetup.sh`
*** enjoy
** Basics
*** Neovim
**** Mostly converted to lua
**** Packer.nvim as my plugin manager
**** Built in LSP, still considering tinkering with DAP
*** Doom Emacs
**** I can't seem to stop using [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] and [[https://magit.vc/][magit]], so I also have some basic config for when I use emacs as my daily driver.
*** AwesomeWM
**** awesomewm-git is the better version for me.
*** Rofi
*** Alacritty
*** Sxhkd
*** Picom
