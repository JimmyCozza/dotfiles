* Basic Structure
** I use arch, btw.
*** When I set up a new machine.  I usually just go with [[https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall][Archinstall]] or something like [[https://endeavouros.com/][EndeavourOS]].
*** I use [[https://awesomewm.org/][AwesomeWM]] as my everyday Window Manager.  I also have xfce installed just in case I break awesome beyond repair...it's nice to have a backup
* Install from empty machine
** Make sure you have an ssh key generated and added to github if you care about that kind of thing:
** =ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@email.com"=
** =git clone git@github.com:JimmyCozza/dotfiles.git=
** =cd dotfiles && ./archSetup.sh=
** enjoy
* Basics
** Neovim
*** Mostly converted to lua
*** Packer.nvim as my plugin manager
*** Built in LSP, still considering tinkering with DAP
** Doom Emacs
*** I can't seem to stop using [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] and [[https://magit.vc/][magit]], so I also have some basic config for when I use emacs as my daily driver.
** AwesomeWM
*** awesomewm-git is the better version for me.
** Rofi
