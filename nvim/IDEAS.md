### vim-dadbod-ui Export Extension

Create an extension to vim-dadbod-ui that offers exporting and formatting options for query results. Current limitation: results are good for viewing but not for copying/pasting in standardized formats like CSV or SQL.

Potential features:
- Export query results to CSV format
- Export as formatted SQL (INSERT statements)
- Copy results to clipboard in various formats
- Save results directly to file
